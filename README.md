# Library Management System (OOP Practice Project)
## Goals
My objective is to become more familar with how object-oriented programming works. This particular project was reccomened to me from ChatGPT. I will design a basic Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The system should allow users to manage books, borrowers, and transactions.

It could be fun to turn this into a REST API, or use something like Flask for user authentication.
